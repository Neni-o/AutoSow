## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Manual Harvesting**

   * Hold the correct seed or planting item in your hand.
   * Right-click a **fully grown crop**.
   * The crop is instantly harvested and replanted at growth stage 0.
   * If *Direct-to-inventory* is enabled, the drops go straight to your inventory.

2. **Dispenser Harvester**

* Place a dispenser facing a fully grown melon block.
* Load it with shears.
* When powered by redstone, the dispenser will automatically harvest the melon:
  - If `WHOLE_MELON_DROP` is set to `true` in the config â†’ drops a whole melon.
  - If set to `false` â†’ drops several melon slices (3â€“7).
* Shears lose 1 durability point for each harvest.
* The same mechanic works for:
  - Pumpkins â†’ always drops a whole pumpkin.
  - Sweet Berries â†’ drops 2â€“3 berries depending on bush age.


3. **Special Cases**

   * **Cocoa Beans** must be attached to jungle wood to be replanted.
   * **Nether Wart** requires Soul Sand beneath it.
   * If the supporting block for a crop is invalid, replanting will be skipped.
