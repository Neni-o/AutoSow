# ðŸŒ± AutoSow

**AutoSow** is a lightweight and performance-friendly **Forge mod** for **Minecraft 1.21.x** that streamlines farming by **automatically harvesting and replanting fully grown crops** when you right-click them with the correct planting item. No more tedious replanting after every harvest â€” just click, collect, and keep farming!

## âœ¨ Features

* ðŸŒ¾ **Supported crops**: Wheat, Carrots, Potatoes, Beetroots, Torchflower, Nether Wart, Cocoa Beans
* âš™ **Per-crop configuration** â€“ enable or disable any supported crop individually in the config file
* ðŸŒ± **Seed consumption toggle** â€“ choose whether replanting uses up seeds/planting items or not
* ðŸ¤– **Dispenser automation** â€“ dispensers can harvest and replant most crops when loaded with the correct seeds (Cocoa Beans excluded for balance)
* ðŸŽ¯ **Direct-to-inventory mode** *(optional)* â€“ harvested items can go straight into your inventory instead of dropping on the ground

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Manual Harvesting**

   * Hold the correct seed or planting item in your hand.
   * Right-click a **fully grown crop**.
   * The crop is instantly harvested and replanted at growth stage 0.
   * If *Direct-to-inventory* is enabled, the drops go straight to your inventory.

2. **Dispenser Automation**

   * Place a dispenser facing a mature crop.
   * Load it with the correct seeds or planting items.
   * When powered, the dispenser will harvest and replant the crop automatically.
   * Works with Wheat, Carrots, Potatoes, Beetroots, Torchflower, and Nether Wart (Cocoa Beans excluded).

3. **Special Cases**

   * **Cocoa Beans** must be attached to jungle wood to be replanted.
   * **Nether Wart** requires Soul Sand beneath it.
   * If the supporting block for a crop is invalid, replanting will be skipped.
